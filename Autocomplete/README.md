Starter code for Project 3 : Autocomplete for CompSci 201 in Spring 2017 semester. This repository includes code to implement, test, and analyze autocomplete for a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight. That is, given a prefix, find all queries that start with the given prefix, in descending order of weight.
